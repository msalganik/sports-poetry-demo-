The beautiful game on grass so green and wide,
Where twenty-two souls chase one checkered sphere,
With skillful feet they dribble, pass with pride,
While millions watch and fill the stands with cheer.

From youth who dream beneath the favela sun,
To stadium lights that pierce the evening sky,
The quest for goals has just begun—
Watch strikers surge as corner kicks fly high.

The goalkeeper stands alone, the last defense,
While midfield generals orchestrate the play,
Each match contains such drama, so intense,
That ninety minutes feel like one long day.
  When final whistle blows and scores are set,
  These memories we'll never quite forget.
```
