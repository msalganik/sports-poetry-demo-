In sport we find humanity expressed,
The striving for excellence and for grace,
Where athletes put their abilities to test,
And push beyond what limits once held place.

Through years of practice, discipline, and pain,
They forge their bodies into perfect tools,
The victories and losses, sun and rain,
All teach them lessons not found in schools.

Spectators gather, drawn by this display,
Of human potential pushed to its extreme,
We cheer for those who show us how to play,
With honor, passion, pursuing their dream.
  In every sport, we see ourselves reflected,
  Our hopes and struggles, beautifully projected.
